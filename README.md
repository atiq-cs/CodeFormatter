# Code Formatter
Formats source code to a consistent style that I follow for my competitive
programming solutions. 
Following actions should be supported,
 - Tab replacement
 - Indentation Fix (both inside/outside comment)
 - Comment style fixing

Additionally, it supports simulation or `noop`.
